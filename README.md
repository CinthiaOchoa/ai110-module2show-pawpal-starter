# PawPal+ (Module 2 Project)

You are building **PawPal+**, a Streamlit app that helps a pet owner plan care tasks for their pet.

## Scenario

A busy pet owner needs help staying consistent with pet care. They want an assistant that can:

- Track pet care tasks (walks, feeding, meds, enrichment, grooming, etc.)
- Consider constraints (time available, priority, owner preferences)
- Produce a daily plan and explain why it chose that plan

Your job is to design the system first (UML), then implement the logic in Python, then connect it to the Streamlit UI.

## What you will build

Your final app should:

- Let a user enter basic owner + pet info
- Let a user add/edit tasks (duration + priority at minimum)
- Generate a daily schedule/plan based on constraints and priorities
- Display the plan clearly (and ideally explain the reasoning)
- Include tests for the most important scheduling behaviors

## Getting started

### Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Suggested workflow

1. Read the scenario carefully and identify requirements and edge cases.
2. Draft a UML diagram (classes, attributes, methods, relationships).
3. Convert UML into Python class stubs (no logic yet).
4. Implement scheduling logic in small increments.
5. Add tests to verify key behaviors.
6. Connect your logic to the Streamlit UI in `app.py`.
7. Refine UML so it matches what you actually built.

1) Task pool — insertion order (out of order)
---------------------------------------------
  ⬜ Quick treat      Mochi      5 min  [low]
  ⬜ Morning walk     Mochi     30 min  [high]
  ⬜ Train commands   Mochi     20 min  [high]
  ⬜ Brush fur        Luna      15 min  [medium]
  ⬜ Feeding          Luna      10 min  [high]

2) sort_tasks() — by priority, then shortest duration
-----------------------------------------------------
  ⬜ Feeding          Luna      10 min  [high]
  ⬜ Train commands   Mochi     20 min  [high]
  ⬜ Morning walk     Mochi     30 min  [high]
  ⬜ Brush fur        Luna      15 min  [medium]
  ⬜ Quick treat      Mochi      5 min  [low]

3) filter_tasks(active_pets={'Mochi'}) — only Mochi's tasks
-----------------------------------------------------------
  ⬜ Quick treat      Mochi      5 min  [low]
  ⬜ Morning walk     Mochi     30 min  [high]
  ⬜ Train commands   Mochi     20 min  [high]

4a) filter_tasks(is_completed=False) — active only (default)
------------------------------------------------------------
  ⬜ Quick treat      Mochi      5 min  [low]
  ⬜ Morning walk     Mochi     30 min  [high]
  ⬜ Train commands   Mochi     20 min  [high]
  ⬜ Feeding          Luna      10 min  [high]

4b) filter_tasks(is_completed=True) — completed only
----------------------------------------------------
  ✅ Brush fur        Luna      15 min  [medium]

5) Final daily plan
------------------
Daily plan for Cinthia (60 min available):
  08:00 — Feeding (10 min) [priority: high] for Luna
  08:10 — Train commands (20 min) [priority: high] for Mochi
  08:30 — Morning walk (30 min) [priority: high] for Mochi
Skipped:
  - Quick treat (Mochi): not enough time left (0 min remaining, needs 5 min)

## 📐 Smarter Scheduling

PawPal+ goes beyond a flat to-do list. The `Scheduler` and `Task` classes work
together to decide **what** to do today, in **what order**, and **how much**
fits — then explain the result. The four algorithmic features below power that.

| Feature | Method(s) | What it does |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Sorting behavior | `Scheduler.sort_tasks()` | Orders tasks by priority rank, then shortest duration |
| Filtering behavior | `Scheduler.filter_tasks()` | Selects tasks by active pet, recurrence, and completion status |
| Recurring task logic | `Task.is_due()`, `Task.mark_completed()` | Schedules the next occurrence using frequency intervals |
| Conflict & overcommitment detection | `Scheduler.build_schedule()` | Flags (without crashing) when high-priority work exceeds the time budget |

### 1. Sorting behavior — `Scheduler.sort_tasks()`

Tasks are ordered so the most important care happens first. The sort key ranks
by **priority** (`high` → `medium` → `low`, via the `PRIORITY_RANK` map) and
breaks ties by **shortest duration**, so quick high-value tasks are placed
before long ones. Priority is negated in the key so it sorts descending while
duration still sorts ascending in a single pass; an unknown priority falls back
to `0` and sorts last instead of raising an error.

### 2. Filtering behavior — `Scheduler.filter_tasks()`

Returns a fresh list of eligible tasks (never mutating the original pool) using
three independent, optional filters:

- **Active pets** — limit the plan to specific pets by name (`active_pets={"Mochi"}`).
- **Recurrence** — when a `day` is given, keep only tasks that are due that day.
- **Completion status** — `is_completed=False` (default) keeps active tasks,
  `True` keeps completed ones, and `None` keeps both.

### 3. Recurring task logic — `Task.is_due()` and `Task.mark_completed()`

Each task has a `frequency` (`daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`) mapped to a day
interval (`1`, `7`, `30`). When `mark_completed(day)` is called, it records the
completion date and uses `datetime.timedelta` to compute the task's `next_due`
date. `is_due(day)` then returns `True` once that date arrives. A completed
recurring task automatically reopens for its next occurrence — so a daily
feeding done today reappears on tomorrow's plan.

### 4. Conflict & overcommitment detection — `Scheduler.build_schedule()`

As it greedily packs tasks into the owner's `available_time`, the scheduler
checks whether the **high-priority workload alone** exceeds the budget. If it
does, it records a friendly warning (e.g. *"High-priority tasks need 80 min but
you have only 60 min — over budget by 20 min"*) in `warnings` and surfaces it in
`explain_plan()`. The plan is still produced — the program flags the conflict
rather than failing.

## 🧪 Testing PawPal+

The logic layer is covered by **15 unit tests** in [`tests/test_pawpal.py`](tests/test_pawpal.py),
written with Python's `unittest` framework. They verify the happy paths
(sorting, building) and the critical edge cases (empty task lists, owners with
no pets, overcommitment, and recurrence intervals). Recurrence tests use fixed
dates for determinism, and each `TestCase` rebuilds fresh objects in `setUp()`
for isolation.

Run the suite with either runner:

```bash
# Option A — pytest
pytest

# Option B — unittest
python -m unittest tests.test_pawpal
```

Sample output (`pytest`):

```
...............                                                          [100%]
15 passed in 0.01s
```

| Area | What's verified |
|------|-----------------|
| Sorting & building | Priority rank → shortest duration ordering, correct start times |
| Filtering | By active pet and by completion status |
| Recurrence | `is_due()` intervals via `timedelta`; completed tasks reopen when due |
| Overcommitment | Warning with the exact overage; over-budget tasks skipped with a reason |
| Edge cases | Empty task list and owner-with-no-pets return safely (no crash) |
